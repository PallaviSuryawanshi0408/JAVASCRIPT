//An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It's like a bridge that allows different software systems to communicate and share information. For instance, a YouTube API enables developers to integrate YouTube's functionalities, like uploading videos, retrieving comments, or managing playlists, into their own applications or websites. This helps in expanding YouTube's features and services beyond its platform. APIs use standardized requests and responses, making it easier for developers to access and use functionalities of a larger software system like YouTube in a consistent and efficient way.
